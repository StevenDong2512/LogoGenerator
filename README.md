## Description

The porpuse of this project is to generate a simple logo with up to three letters featured in the shape. To build this project, I have used inquirer to generate a questioner, and this will then records user's responses, then the logo will be generated for user to preview. 

## Installation

1. install vs code.
2. clone repo and download npm. 
3. download inquirer.
4. use node index.js to run the application. 
5. answer the questions accordingly in the terminal. 
6. logo should be generated for users to preview.
